This program is a back end for a simple polling application.

Basically, you register a poll, present options, and other people have to vote.

This program uses cookies that are saved on the PC, meaning a user cannot vote more than once within a certain time frame. If they vote for another option, it will only change their vote.

The project dependencies are in the package.json file.
